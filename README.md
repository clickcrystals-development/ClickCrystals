## Scripting Now Has a Wiki!

Want to script custom modules but don't know how to script?
Don't worry, there's a full guide on how to create your own custom scripts and modules!

ClickCrystals script is an interrupted scripting language that allows you to scripts and macros
without any knowledge of coding. It contains no variables and mostly are just command lines that
are very similar to Minecraft.
